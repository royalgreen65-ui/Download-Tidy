# Download Tidy - Installation Guide

Because this app uses the **File System Access API** (to move your files) and **ES Modules**, it must be run from a local web server.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.
2. **Windows**: Double-click `run.bat`.
3. **Mac/Linux**: Open terminal in this folder and run `sh run.sh`.
4. The terminal will give you a link (usually `http://localhost:3000`). Open this in **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge**.

## How to turn it into an ".exe" (Desktop App)
Once you have the app open in your browser:
1. Look at the Address Bar (top right).
2. Click the **Install Icon** (it looks like a computer with an arrow or a '+' sign).
3. Click **Install**.
4. The app will now appear on your Desktop and in your Start Menu/Dock as a standalone program.
